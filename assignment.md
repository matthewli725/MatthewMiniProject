# Matthew's take-home mini assignment

**Task: build an ML model which, given an image, identifies whether it is a cat üêà , hotdog üå≠ , or neither.**

Requirements:

1. track entire project using `git` and `github` (i should be able to see a commit history full of incremental changes, not just one single repo dump)
2. manage dependencies using a tool called `uv` (you've probably never heard of this tool, which is why I'm making you use it. I want to see how you learn a new tool) (`uv` is an amazing tool btw) I should be able to clone your repo, call `uv sync`, and immediately be able to run the project.
3. use `PyTorch` to build your model (the entire lab uses `torch`)
4. go find your own dataset (or download images from google)
5. you are not allowed to have any files ending in `.ipynb` in your repo (yes, I'm banning the use of jupyter notebooks. I have my reasons which I'm happy to explain to you if you're interested)
6. keep good documentation. It shouldn't be a pain for me to understand your codebase or you shouldn't need to explain to me how to use your model (that's what the `README` is for)
7. if you don't have enough compute, come find me and I can run your training on a lab server

Be creative, I don't care *HOW* you solve this problem. Use any model architecture you'd like, train from scratch or finetune, I don't care.

Try to finish by Wednesday, don't hesitate to ask me questions.

**Most importantly, GLHF!**
