Matthew's first ML mini project

Task: When given an image, identify whether it is a cat, hotdog, or neither.

Thoughts on how to approach
1. Figure out how to use Github
2. Find dataset for cat/not cat and hotdog/not hotdog
3. follow pytorch tutorial on creating a simple model
4. figure out how to use uv to manage dependencies
5. look up and research more advanced models and fine tune parameters
6. figure out how to deal with more advanced problems (distorted image, when a cat and hotdog is both in an image, etc.)
7. idk
